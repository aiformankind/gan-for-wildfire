# gan-for-wildfire

Task for Volunteer:

Explore and investigate the use of GAN in early wildfire smoke detection. 
- Build a GAN to help us generate synthetic wildfire smoke images.

Expected Deliverables:
1. End to end notebook to generate synthetic wildfire smoke images so that we can replicate the experiment.
2. Evaluation metrics.
3. Provide links to reference papers/tutorials.

Useful Resources for Volunteers:
1. Wildfire-Detection Method Using DenseNet and CycleGAN Data Augmentation-Based Remote Camera Imagery
